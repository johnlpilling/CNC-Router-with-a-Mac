# CNC-Router-with-a-Mac
eleksmaker A3 base with z axis conversion to be used as a CNC engraver/router with A MAC
after a nightmare with what I discovered turned out to be fake chinese chips Ive now bought a genuine arduino and need help with this as I can get x,y and z to move but cannot get the spindle to turn constantly. 
Currently it simply revs
